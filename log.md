# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1, for the tenth time: 13 Novem 2020 (GitHub)
**Today's Progress:** I've learned a bit more about showing my progresses on GitHub. I've also completed the ReadMe file. 
  It's 1.35 am and probably should go to bed, cause tomorrow at 10 am I start an hackathon (ActInSpace).... but I'm too into it now and need to copy a repository in the right       folder, since I reorganised my 100 code agenda.  
**Thoughts:** Really should go to bed, even becasue I'm not sure how to put a all exercise description in the new repositery. But hey, YOLO.
