### Day 1, for the tenth time: 13 Novem 2020 (GitHub)
**Today's Progress:** I've learned a bit more about showing my progresses on GitHub. I've also completed the ReadMe file. 
  It's 1.35 am and probably should go to bed, cause tomorrow at 10 am I start an hackathon (ActInSpace).... but I'm too into it now and need to copy a repository in the right       folder, since I reorganised my 100 code agenda.  
**Thoughts:** Really should go to bed, even becasue I'm not sure how to put a all exercise description in the new repositery. But hey, YOLO.
### Day 2, for the tenth time: 17 Novem 2020 (Reading external data & Plotting) Tot hours: 40 minutes
I've taken time off because on the weekend I've done the ActInSpace hackathon 2020. **TAKE CARE OF YOUR MIND**, I needed a break and rest
**Today's Progress:** Sarted to work on exercise 5 = Pandas - Reading CSV and Basic Plotting. 
 I tried to use **Virtual Studio Code** but really failed. 
 Created an excel file to put the new commands I learn. It will be use my **Coding Encyclopedia**
